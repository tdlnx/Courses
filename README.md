# Courses

This is where I'll be keeping notes/projects/personal resources for any online courses I might take. I'll also link to the course in each folder just in case anyone comes across this and wants to take the course as well.

It's very likely nobody will read this, but if you're reading this now, hi there!

[The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

[PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/)

[PHP Practitioner (Laracasts)](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners) <- This one is MUCH better than the uDemy course. Lessons 1-5 don't have any files here because they were mostly about setting up your code editor, etc. Lesson 6 is where the actual class begins.
